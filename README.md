# Federated Clinical Concept and Disease Semantic Learning for Congenital Heart Disease Diagnosis

First-trimester screening for congenital heart disease provides opportunities for earlier diagnosis and intervention, but is challenged by limited data availability. However, sharing multi-site data is infeasible due to various privacy issues. Federated learning  has emerged as a solution, enabling training across hospitals without directly sharing patient data. Here, we establish Federated Congenital Heart Disease Learning framework to tackle the above challenges, which transfers knowledge among multiple healthcare centers.
A key challenge lies in variation across hospitals, which leads to inconsistent representations of clinical concepts and disease subtypes. This inconsistency significantly degrades the performance of federated congenital heart disease analysis.
To address these issues, this paper proposes federated prototypes on clinical concept and disease subtype views to calibrate multi-party updates.
Our platform orchestrates federated training for joint congenital heart disease classification across four popular sites. The proposed method achieves a 10.3\% improvement in F1 score, a 5.1\% increase in sensitivity, and a 1.0\% improvement in specificity compared with state-of-the-art federated optimization methods, while ensuring privacy protection.
Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization and consistently outperforms baseline methods. We envision this study as a step toward a privacy-preserving, heterogeneity-adaptive federated framework for first-trimester congenital heart disease diagnosis, enabling earlier and more effective clinical interventions.
